I couldn't upload the files normally on GitHub because it gave me a lot of errors when I tried. For example it said that there are too many files, or that they are too big, or that some files are hidden, but I didn't set them to hidden at all. So this is my last resort of uploading them, via this sendbig link. It's like wetransfer.
