I couldn't upload the files normally on GitHub because it gave me a lot of errors when I tried. For example it said that there are too many files, or that they are too big, or that some files are hidden, but I didn't set them to hidden at all. So this is my last resort of uploading them, via this sendbig link(it's like wetransfer) and uploading the 7zip files(select all of them at once and unzip).
